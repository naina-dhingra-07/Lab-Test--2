# LabTest-2
Web Development-1 Lab Assesment-2 

Objective: Create a personal portfolio webpage using an external CSS stylesheet with a consistent color theme, custom fonts, and structured layouts. Include styled navigation, skill tables, buttons, and visual elements for a polished and professional look. 

Outcome and Procedure: I started with creating a HTML file titled index.html, here I tried my best to accurately use semantic tags, class, div, table, form and id. Once a basic personal portfolio was created I moved onto styling it using extternal CSS. I created a style.css file and used all the styling methods that we had learned in class. I added background color to various elements using rgb as mentioned in the assignment. Also attempted to create a sticky navigation bar and back to top button. This is was my first styling project so I kept the color theme very simple. I added comments to structure my code and make it readable.
